In this work, we have presented the Yluthoor Model, a new phenomenological effective parametrization for the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$. Our analysis shows that this geometric approach provides a remarkably robust fit to the late-time cosmological data, specifically when tested against Cosmic Chronometers and the Pantheon+ SNIa compilation.

The primary finding of our study is that the Yluthoor Model achieves a minimum $\chi^2$ of 1026.42, which is numerically superior to the $1026.86$ obtained by the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using the same dataset. Although the Information Criteria (AIC and BIC) indicate a slight statistical preference for the $\Lambda$CDM model due to its fewer degrees of freedom, the difference in AIC ($\Delta AIC = 1.56$) places the Yluthoor Model within the range of "weak evidence" against it, making both models statistically indistinguishable in the current observational landscape.

The success of this "fusquinha" (effective geometric model) in competing with the "Ferrari" (Standard $\Lambda$CDM) underscores the importance of exploring alternative functional forms to describe cosmic acceleration. The Yluthoor Model serves as a valuable tool for testing the consistency of expansion data without the theoretical priors of a cosmological constant. Future surveys with higher precision at high redshifts will be crucial to further constrain the parameters $a, b,$ and $k$, potentially revealing whether the subtle deviations found here are the key to resolving the ongoing Hubble tension.
